## Live Side
https://infinitelooping.github.io/Travis-Lloyd-Password-Generator/

## Used variously learned strategies
stratagies were used to create the first 1-4 characters that have at least one of every char type user wanted
switches were used to insure randomness of the rest of the string
to insure the first 4 strings werent as predictable added a for loop that would randomize all strings in the passwors string
